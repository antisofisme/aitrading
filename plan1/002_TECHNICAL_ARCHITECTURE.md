- **Enhancement**: AI-focused pipeline integration + Event-driven architecture
- **Deployment**: Separate Docker Compose for client/server + Serverless containers
- **Communication**: Event-driven (Kafka/NATS) + REST APIs + WebSocket + gRPC
- **Resilience**: Circuit breaker patterns + Chaos engineering
- **Compliance**: Real-time regulatory monitoring + audit trails
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry + distributed tracing + APM

## 🚀 **2024 Architecture Enhancements**

```

## 🎯 **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**

### **ADR-001: Event-Driven Architecture Implementation**
**Decision**: Implement Apache Kafka as primary event streaming platform
**Rationale**:
- High-throughput trading events require reliable message delivery
- Event sourcing needed for regulatory compliance (7-year audit trail)
- Decouples services for better scalability and resilience
**Consequences**:
- Additional infrastructure complexity
- Improved system resilience and scalability
- Enhanced regulatory compliance capabilities

### **ADR-002: Circuit Breaker Pattern Integration**
**Decision**: Implement circuit breakers using Hystrix/Envoy at service boundaries
**Rationale**:
- EU regulations require system resilience mechanisms
- Trading systems cannot afford cascade failures
- Market volatility requires adaptive failure handling
**Consequences**:
- Improved system stability under stress
- Better handling of downstream service failures
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting capabilities

### **ADR-003: Regulatory Compliance by Design**
**Decision**: Build compliance monitoring as first-class architectural component
**Rationale**:
- MiFID II and EMIR regulations require real-time monitoring
- Audit trails must be immutable and complete
- Regulatory reporting must be automated and reliable
**Consequences**:
- Additional development and operational overhead
- Reduced compliance risk and manual effort
- Enhanced audit and reporting capabilities

### **ADR-004: Simplified Configuration Management**
**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL-based configuration service instead of complex vault solutions
**Rationale**:
- Reduces operational complexity and maintenance overhead
- Provides sufficient security for trading system requirements
- Faster development and deployment cycles
- Lower cost and resource requirements
**Consequences**:
- Reduced infrastructure complexity and costs ($5K vs complex setup)
- Simplified backup and recovery procedures
- Easier troubleshooting and maintenance
- Basic encryption sufficient for current security requirements
