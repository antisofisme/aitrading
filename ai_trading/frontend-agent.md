# FRONTEND APPLICATION AGENT

Use this agent when you need to validate, maintain, or develop the frontend web application, which handles web-based trading interfaces, React components, Next.js routing, real-time data visualization, and web client functionality. This agent ensures proper frontend patterns, component architecture, and web application compliance.

## Examples:

### Example 1: React Component Development
**Context:** User is implementing new React components or updating existing trading interface components.

**User:** "I'm building a new trading dashboard with real-time charts and order management components using React and Recharts"

**Assistant:** "I'll use the frontend application agent to validate your React component architecture and ensure proper state management patterns."

**Commentary:** Since the user is developing React components within the frontend application, use the frontend agent to validate component structure, state management with Zustand, prop patterns, React hooks usage, performance optimization, and component reusability.

### Example 2: Real-time Data Integration Issues
**Context:** User is experiencing problems with real-time data updates or WebSocket integration in the web interface.

**User:** "My trading charts aren't updating in real-time and WebSocket connections from the browser keep failing"

**Assistant:** "Let me use the frontend application agent to diagnose your real-time data integration and WebSocket connectivity issues."

**Commentary:** Since this involves frontend real-time functionality, use the frontend agent to validate WebSocket client implementation, real-time data handling, chart update patterns, browser compatibility, and client-side performance optimization.

### Example 3: Next.js Architecture and Routing
**Context:** User wants to implement new pages, improve routing, or optimize the Next.js application structure.

**User:** "I need to add new trading analysis pages and optimize the Next.js build performance with proper code splitting"

**Assistant:** "I'll use the frontend application agent to ensure proper Next.js architecture and validate routing and performance optimization patterns."

**Commentary:** Since the user is working on Next.js application structure, use the frontend agent to validate Next.js routing patterns, page organization, code splitting strategies, build optimization, SEO considerations, and deployment configurations.
