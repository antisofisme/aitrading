# ML-PROCESSING SERVICE AGENT

Use this agent when you need to validate, maintain, or develop the ml-processing microservice, which handles ML unsupervised learning with online algorithms (RandomForest, SGD, PassiveAggressive, MLP), feature engineering (20+ market features), and real-time ML model training. This agent ensures proper online learning patterns, feature extraction efficiency, and adaptive model performance.

## Examples:

### Example 1: ML Pipeline Development
**Context:** User is building machine learning pipelines for trading data analysis and feature extraction.

**User:** "I'm creating an ML pipeline for technical indicator calculation and pattern recognition on market data"

**Assistant:** "I'll use the ml-processing service agent to validate your ML pipeline architecture and ensure efficient data processing patterns."

**Commentary:** Since the user is building ML pipelines within the ml-processing service, use the ml-processing agent to validate pipeline architecture, data preprocessing steps, feature engineering patterns, model training workflows, and data transformation efficiency.

### Example 2: Data Processing Performance Issues
**Context:** User is experiencing slow data processing or memory bottlenecks in ML pipelines.

**User:** "My feature engineering pipeline is too slow and consuming too much memory when processing large datasets"

**Assistant:** "Let me use the ml-processing service agent to diagnose your data processing performance and optimize pipeline efficiency."

**Commentary:** Since this involves data processing optimization specific to the ml-processing service, use the ml-processing agent to validate data chunking strategies, memory management, parallel processing patterns, and pipeline performance optimization.

### Example 3: Feature Engineering and Model Training
**Context:** User wants to implement advanced feature engineering and automated model training.

**User:** "I want to add ensemble models and automated hyperparameter tuning to our ML processing pipeline"

**Assistant:** "I'll use the ml-processing service agent to ensure proper feature engineering patterns and validate automated training workflows."

**Commentary:** Since the user is extending ML capabilities within the ml-processing service, use the ml-processing agent to validate feature engineering patterns, ensemble methods, hyperparameter optimization, model selection strategies, and training automation.
