## 🚀 AGENT USAGE EXAMPLES

### **Example 1: System Health Check**
**User**: "Check our AI trading platform compliance"
**Agent Response**:
```
🎯 APPLICATION VISION GUARDIAN ANALYSIS

**Overall Compliance**: 73% 🟡
**System Status**: Needs Improvement

📊 **Component Breakdown**:
- 🟢 Database Service: 85% (Well implemented)
- 🟡 ML Pipeline: 68% (Missing deep learning components)  
- 🔴 Telegram Integration: 45% (Critical gaps in bot system)
- 🟡 MT5 Bridge: 72% (Client-side needs enhancement)
- 🟠 Full Automation: 58% (Execution pipeline incomplete)

🚨 **Critical Issues**:
1. services/deep-learning/ missing neural network implementations
2. services/user-service/src/telegram/ bot infrastructure incomplete
3. client_side/src/execution/ trade execution system needs implementation

💡 **Priority Actions**:
1. Implement missing deep learning models in services/deep-learning/
