# Cloudflare WARP Setup Guide for Data Bridge Service

This guide shows how to set up Cloudflare WARP as an application-level proxy for the Dukascopy client, allowing you to bypass regional blocking without affecting your entire PC's internet connection.

## üîë Key Point: Application-Only Impact

**WARP will ONLY affect the Python application when configured as a proxy** - your PC's internet connection remains unchanged.

## üìã Prerequisites

1. Windows 10/11 (WARP client required)
2. Cloudflare WARP key: `XrfV4782-W2X39u4G-h49e78ya`
3. Data bridge service running

## üöÄ Setup Steps

### Step 1: Install Cloudflare WARP

1. Download Cloudflare WARP from: https://1.1.1.1/
2. Install the application
3. **DO NOT** enable "WARP" mode in the GUI (this affects entire PC)

### Step 2: Configure WARP for Proxy Mode

1. **Open Command Prompt as Administrator**
2. **Navigate to WARP installation directory**:
   ```cmd
   cd "C:\Program Files\Cloudflare\Cloudflare WARP"
   ```

3. **Register your WARP key**:
   ```cmd
   warp-cli registration new
   warp-cli set-license XrfV4782-W2X39u4G-h49e78ya
   ```

4. **Enable proxy mode (APPLICATION-LEVEL ONLY)**:
   ```cmd
   warp-cli set-mode proxy
   warp-cli connect
   ```

5. **Verify proxy is running**:
   ```cmd
   warp-cli status
   ```
   You should see: `Status update: Connected` and `Mode: Proxy`

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variable

Add your WARP key to the data-bridge service environment:

```env
# In server_microservice/.env
CLOUDFLARE_WARP_KEY=XrfV4782-W2X39u4G-h49e78ya
```

### Step 4: Test WARP Integration

Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
cd server_microservice/services/data-bridge
python test_warp_integration.py
```

## üîß WARP Proxy Configuration

When WARP is in proxy mode, it exposes:
- **HTTP Proxy**: `http://127.0.0.1:40000`
- **SOCKS5 Proxy**: `socks5://127.0.0.1:40000`

The data bridge service will automatically detect and use the proxy when the WARP key is configured.

## üåê How It Works

1. **Application-Level**: Only HTTP requests from the Python application use WARP
2. **Selective Routing**: Dukascopy downloads route through Cloudflare's network
3. **Transparent Failover**: If WARP fails, automatically falls back to direct connection
4. **No System Impact**: Your browser, other apps, and Windows networking unchanged

## üìä Verification Commands

### Check WARP Status
```cmd
warp-cli status
```

### Test Proxy Connectivity
```cmd
curl --proxy http://127.0.0.1:40000 http://httpbin.org/ip
```

### Check IP Address Through Proxy
```python
import requests
response = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/ip', proxies={'http': 'http://127.0.0.1:40000'})
print(response.json())
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### WARP Not Starting
```cmd
# Stop and restart WARP service
net stop "Cloudflare WARP"
net start "Cloudflare WARP"

# Or restart from CLI
warp-cli disconnect
warp-cli connect
```

### Proxy Not Accessible
```cmd
# Check if WARP is in proxy mode
warp-cli status

# Switch to proxy mode if needed
warp-cli set-mode proxy
warp-cli connect
```

### License Issues
```cmd
# Re-register license
warp-cli registration delete
warp-cli registration new
warp-cli set-license XrfV4782-W2X39u4G-h49e78ya
```

## üîê Security Notes

- WARP key is provided by user and stored in environment variables
- All traffic through WARP is encrypted
- No personal data is logged by Cloudflare in proxy mode
- Application-level proxy ensures minimal security surface

## üìà Performance Benefits

- **Bypass Regional Blocks**: Access Dukascopy servers from any location
- **Improved Reliability**: Cloudflare's global network provides better routing
- **Automatic Failover**: Falls back to direct connection if WARP unavailable
- **No System Overhead**: Only affects specific application requests

## üîÑ Disable WARP

To disable WARP proxy (return to direct connection):

```cmd
warp-cli disconnect
```

Or remove the environment variable:
```env
# Remove or comment out
# CLOUDFLARE_WARP_KEY=XrfV4782-W2X39u4G-h49e78ya
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Application-Only**: WARP proxy mode only affects the Python application, not your entire PC
2. **Fallback Mechanism**: If WARP fails, downloads automatically use direct connection
3. **No Always-On**: WARP is only used when explicitly configured in the application
4. **License Management**: Your WARP key enables the proxy functionality
5. **Performance**: WARP may improve or worsen speeds depending on your location

## üéØ Expected Behavior

With WARP properly configured:

1. ‚úÖ Dukascopy downloads use WARP proxy automatically
2. ‚úÖ Your browser and other apps use direct connection
3. ‚úÖ If WARP fails, downloads fall back to direct connection
4. ‚úÖ No changes to Windows networking or system proxy settings
5. ‚úÖ Regional blocks are bypassed transparently

This setup provides the best of both worlds: bypassing regional restrictions for the trading application while keeping the rest of your system unchanged.
