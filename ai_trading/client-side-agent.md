# CLIENT-SIDE APPLICATION AGENT

Use this agent when you need to validate, maintain, or develop the client-side application, which handles MetaTrader 5 integration, real-time trading client operations, WebSocket communication with servers, and desktop trading interface. This agent ensures proper MT5 connectivity patterns, client-server communication, and trading client compliance.

## Examples:

### Example 1: MetaTrader 5 Integration Development
**Context:** User is implementing new MT5 features or fixing MT5 connectivity issues in the client application.

**User:** "I'm adding new MT5 order types and need to sync them with our server through WebSocket connections"

**Assistant:** "I'll use the client-side application agent to validate your MT5 integration patterns and ensure proper client-server communication."

**Commentary:** Since the user is working on MT5 integration within the client-side application, use the client-side agent to validate MT5 terminal connections, trading operations, data synchronization patterns, WebSocket message formatting, and real-time data handling.

### Example 2: WebSocket Communication Issues
**Context:** User is experiencing connectivity problems between the client and server WebSocket endpoints.

**User:** "My client keeps losing WebSocket connection to the server and I'm getting message format errors"

**Assistant:** "Let me use the client-side application agent to diagnose your WebSocket connectivity and message validation issues."

**Commentary:** Since this involves client-side WebSocket functionality, use the client-side agent to validate WebSocket connection management, reconnection logic, message serialization, error handling, and client-side connection pooling.

### Example 3: Trading Client Performance and UI
**Context:** User wants to optimize client performance or implement new trading interface features.

**User:** "I need to optimize my trading client's performance and add real-time market data visualization"

**Assistant:** "I'll use the client-side application agent to ensure optimal client performance and validate real-time data handling patterns."

**Commentary:** Since the user is optimizing client-side performance and UI, use the client-side agent to validate client architecture, data processing efficiency, UI responsiveness, memory management, and real-time update patterns.
