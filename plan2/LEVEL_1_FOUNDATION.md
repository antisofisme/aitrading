Daily Infrastructure Development Cycle:
  Morning Session (4 hours):
    Phase 1 (30 min): Context Review
      - Review CLAUDE.md for infrastructure context
      - Validate previous day's Central Hub changes
      - Plan infrastructure task with human oversight

    Phase 2 (2.5 hours): AI Development
      - AI implements infrastructure components
      - Generate infrastructure code with documentation
      - Include testing and validation for Central Hub
      - Update CLAUDE.md with infrastructure decisions

    Phase 3 (1 hour): Human Validation
      - Human reviews infrastructure code quality
      - Validates Central Hub integration correctness
      - Tests functionality and performance impact
      - Approves or requests infrastructure modifications
```
