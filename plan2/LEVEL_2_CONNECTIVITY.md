# LEVEL 2 - CONNECTIVITY: Data Flow & Integration Architecture

## 2.1 MT5 Integration & Data Pipeline

### High-Performance MT5 Integration
```yaml
Connection Pool Management:
  Connection Pool (5 persistent connections) → Load Balancer → MT5 Terminal

Signal Processing Pipeline:
  Server signals → WebSocket (sub-10ms) → Batch Validation → Parallel Execution

Performance Optimization:
  Predictive Loading → Symbol Pre-cache → Memory Pool → <50ms execution

Error Recovery System:
  Circuit Breaker → Exponential Backoff → Health Monitoring → Auto-reconnection

MT5 Security & Performance:
  Connection Management:
    - 5 persistent connections per account (optimal throughput)
    - Connection health monitoring every 30 seconds
    - Auto-scaling based on signal volume
    - Circuit breaker pattern for cascade failure prevention

  Signal Execution:
    - Batch processing (100 signals per validation call)
    - Parallel execution across multiple connections
    - Predictive market data loading
    - Sub-50ms total signal-to-execution latency

  Credential Security:
    - Windows DPAPI encryption for MT5 credentials
    - Session-based credential access with server validation
    - 24-hour auto-expiry for security credentials
    - No plain-text storage anywhere in the system

  Error Handling:
    - Exponential backoff (1s → 30s max)
    - Error-specific recovery strategies
    - 99.9% uptime target with auto-reconnection
    - Real-time performance metrics and alerting
```
