    Mitigation Strategies:
      - Version pinning for all dependencies
      - Backup service providers identified
      - Mock services for development

    Contingency Plans:
      If OpenAI API changes:
        → Switch to DeepSeek or Google AI
        → Use local models as fallback
        → Implement adapter pattern

      If MetaTrader connectivity issues:
        → Use demo/paper trading mode
        → Implement data simulation
        → Use alternative data providers

  R008: Security Vulnerabilities
    Risk: Security issues dalam hybrid system
    Probability: Low (20%)
    Impact: Medium (Compliance issues)
    Mitigation: Security review at each phase gate

Connectivity Performance Monitoring:
  Daily Risk Check:
    - Any connectivity blockers that could impact timeline?
