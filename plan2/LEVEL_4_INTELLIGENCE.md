### AI/ML Risk Management
> **Note**: Complete risk framework in [RISK_MANAGEMENT_FRAMEWORK](RISK_MANAGEMENT_FRAMEWORK.md#r002-aiml-pipeline-complexity-overwhelm)
```yaml
AI/ML Pipeline Complexity Risk:
  R002: AI/ML Pipeline Complexity Overwhelm
    Risk Description: AI/ML pipeline development ternyata jauh lebih kompleks dari estimasi
    Probability: Medium-High (40%)
    Impact: High (Timeline dan quality impact)

    Root Causes:
      - ML model complexity underestimated
      - Data preprocessing requirements complex
      - Model training time longer than expected
      - Integration dengan existing services difficult

    Mitigation Strategies:
      Primary: Phased ML development - start dengan simplest models
      Secondary: Use pre-trained models initially
      Tertiary: External ML service integration (OpenAI, etc.)

    Contingency Plans:
      Week 3-4 if ML development behind schedule:
        → Reduce model complexity (XGBoost only, skip deep learning)
        → Use rule-based trading logic as backup
        → Implement advanced AI in post-launch phases

      If ML performance tidak acceptable:
        → Switch to ensemble of simple models
        → Focus on feature engineering excellence
        → Use external AI services as fallback

    Simplified Fallback Path:
      Phase 2A (Week 3): Basic feature engineering only
      Phase 2B (Week 4): Simple supervised ML (XGBoost)
      Phase 2C (Post-launch): Advanced deep learning

    Early Warning Indicators:
      - Model accuracy <50% after 2 days training
      - Feature engineering taking >1 day per indicator type
      - Integration tests failing repeatedly
      - AI assistant struggling dengan ML concepts

    Decision Tree:
      Week 3 Day 2: Assess ML complexity reality
      Week 4 Day 1: Go/No-Go on advanced ML features

AI Performance Risk Management:
  AI Model Accuracy Thresholds:
    - Minimum acceptable accuracy: >60% for any model
    - Production deployment threshold: >70% accuracy
    - Confidence scoring requirement: >75% for actionable signals
    - Model drift detection: <5% distribution shift tolerance

  Phase 2 Go/No-Go Criteria (End of Week 4):
    GO Criteria:
      ✅ At least 2 ML services operational (supervised + 1 other)

      ✅ Trading Engine receiving AI inputs successfully
      ✅ End-to-end data flow working
      ✅ Performance targets met (<200ms predictions)

    NO-GO Actions:
      → Simplify AI to rule-based system
      → Implement advanced AI post-launch
      → Continue dengan basic trading system
```
