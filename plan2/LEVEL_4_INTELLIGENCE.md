        → Reduce model complexity (XGBoost only, skip deep learning)
        → Use rule-based trading logic as backup
        → Implement advanced AI in post-launch phases

      If ML performance tidak acceptable:
        → Switch to ensemble of simple models
        → Focus on feature engineering excellence
        → Use external AI services as fallback

    Simplified Fallback Path:
      Phase 2A (Week 3): Basic feature engineering only

      - AI assistant struggling dengan ML concepts

    Decision Tree:
      Week 3 Day 2: Assess ML complexity reality
      Week 4 Day 1: Go/No-Go on advanced ML features

AI Performance Risk Management:
  AI Model Accuracy Thresholds:
    - Minimum acceptable accuracy: >60% for any model
    - Production deployment threshold: >70% accuracy
    - Confidence scoring requirement: >75% for actionable signals
    - Model drift detection: <5% distribution shift tolerance

  Phase 2 Go/No-Go Criteria (End of Week 4):
    GO Criteria:
      ✅ At least 2 ML services operational (supervised + 1 other)
      ✅ Basic AI predictions generating dengan >60% accuracy
      ✅ Trading Engine receiving AI inputs successfully
      ✅ End-to-end data flow working
      ✅ Performance targets met (<200ms predictions)

    NO-GO Actions:
      → Simplify AI to rule-based system
      → Implement advanced AI post-launch
      → Continue dengan basic trading system
```
