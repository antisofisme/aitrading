```

### GDPR Compliance
```yaml
Data Minimization:
  - Only essential trading and security events kept long-term
  - Debug and development logs automatically purged
  - Personal data anonymized after 90 days

Right to be Forgotten:
  - User-specific logs can be selectively deleted
  - Anonymization process for audit trails
  - Retention override for legal holds

Data Protection Impact:
  - 75% reduction in personal data storage
  - Automated deletion prevents data accumulation
  - Clear retention justification for remaining data

Financial Compliance:
  Trading Records: 1 year retention (CRITICAL level)
    - Trade execution logs
    - Risk management decisions
    - Client trading signals
    - Compliance audit events

  Security Events: 1 year retention (CRITICAL level)
    - Authentication attempts
    - Authorization failures
    - Security policy violations
    - Incident response logs
