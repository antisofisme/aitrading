### AI Trading Enhanced User Interface Risk Management
> **Note**: Complete risk assessment in [RISK_MANAGEMENT_FRAMEWORK](RISK_MANAGEMENT_FRAMEWORK.md#r005-scope-creep-and-feature-expansion)
> **Note**: AI trading integration risks in [docs/AI_TRADING_INTEGRATION.md](docs/AI_TRADING_INTEGRATION.md#migration-risks)

```yaml
AI_Trading_Integration_UI_Risks:
  R005A: AI Trading Component Integration Complexity
    Risk Description: Complexity in migrating ai_trading dashboard and Telegram bot to business context
    Probability: Medium (40% - reduced due to proven foundation)
    Impact: Medium (Timeline and integration effort)
    Mitigation: Proven ai_trading components reduce unknown risks, incremental migration approach

  R005B: Multi-Agent UI Complexity
    Risk Description: Multi-agent coordination visualization adds UI complexity beyond ai_trading baseline
    Probability: Medium (50%)
    Impact: Medium (Development effort and user experience)
    Mitigation: Phase multi-agent features, start with ai_trading proven UI patterns

User Experience Risks:
  R005: Scope Creep and Feature Expansion (Enhanced with AI Trading Context)
    Risk Description: Stakeholders request additional UI features beyond ai_trading + business focus
    Probability: Medium (50% - reduced due to ai_trading proven baseline)
    Impact: Medium (Budget and timeline)

    Mitigation Strategies:
      - Strict adherence to ai_trading + business enhancement focus (Web, Desktop, API, Telegram)
      - Clear change control process for UI features beyond ai_trading proven baseline
      - Phase-gate approvals required for new UI components not in ai_trading heritage
      - Feature parking lot for post-launch UI enhancements beyond business requirements
      - Leverage ai_trading mobile access through enhanced Telegram bot (no native mobile development)

    Contingency Plans:
      If UI scope increases >20% beyond ai_trading + business baseline:
        → Defer non-priority features to post-launch (maintain ai_trading proven features)
        → Maintain focus on ai_trading heritage (PC Windows, web browsers, Telegram)
        → Increase timeline by 1 week max (reduced from 2 weeks due to ai_trading foundation)
        → Require additional budget approval for features beyond ai_trading + business scope

    Change Control Process:
      Any new UI feature request:
        → Validate against ai_trading heritage + business enhancement scope
        → Assess if feature exists in ai_trading (lower risk) or is new development (higher risk)
        → Impact assessment required with ai_trading baseline comparison
        → Stakeholder approval needed with business value justification
        → Timeline/budget adjustment approved based on ai_trading complexity baseline
        → UI documentation updated with ai_trading integration notes

  R007: Documentation and Knowledge Transfer
    Risk: Inadequate UI documentation causing future maintenance issues
    Probability: Medium (40%)
    Impact: Low (Long-term maintenance)
    Mitigation: UI documentation requirements in each phase
