# Problems Found During Plan Refactoring

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Content Loss During Initial Refactoring
- **Issue**: Major technical content lost when moving from traditional plan structure to LEVEL files
- **Lost Content**:
  - Event-driven architecture details (Kafka/NATS)
  - Regulatory compliance architecture (Ports 8017-8019)
  - Business foundation content (Midtrans, multi-user systems)
  - Implementation timelines and team coordination
- **Impact**: Development guidance incomplete, missing critical specifications

### 2. LEVEL File Structure Issues
- **LEVEL_3**: Wrong title (DATA_FLOW vs business logic content)
- **LEVEL_4**: Contains implementation code instead of strategy
- **LEVEL_5**: Mixed UI specs with deployment procedures
- **Impact**: Broken dependency hierarchy, confusing abstraction levels

### 3. Original Plan Backup
- **Solution**: Created plan_asli/ folder with all original content from git commit 87c226b
- **Status**: All 13 original files preserved (304KB total)
- **Files**: Complete original plan structure available for reference

## Next Steps
1. Follow plan/README.md methodology strictly
2. Process files one by one carefully
3. Check each file individually before proceeding
4. Document any issues in this file immediately
