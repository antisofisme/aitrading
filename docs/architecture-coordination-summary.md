## üîß **ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN DECISIONS**

### **1. Service Independence Preservation**
- **Decision**: Maintain microservice independence
- **Implementation**: Each service implements its own probability infrastructure
- **Rationale**: Prevents single points of failure, enables independent scaling

### **2. Multi-Tenant Isolation Strategy**
- **Decision**: Implement probability isolation at multiple layers
- **Implementation**:
  - Database level: Tenant-specific table partitioning
  - Service level: Tenant-aware probability calculations
  - Cache level: Tenant-namespaced probability caching
- **Rationale**: Ensures data privacy and prevents cross-tenant contamination

### **3. Performance Optimization Approach**
- **Decision**: Parallel probability processing with caching
- **Implementation**:
  - Multi-level probability caching (L1: Memory, L2: Redis, L3: Database)
  - GPU acceleration for probability mathematics
  - Asynchronous probability calculation pipelines
- **Rationale**: Meet <100ms probability calculation target

### **4. Data Consistency Strategy**
- **Decision**: Event-driven probability updates with eventual consistency
- **Implementation**:
  - Probability events published via existing event system
  - Eventual consistency acceptable for probability data
  - Strong consistency for critical trading decisions
- **Rationale**: Balance between performance and consistency
