# LEVEL 2 CONNECTIVITY - Implementation Roadmap
**AI Trading Platform - Business Services & Multi-Tenant Architecture**

## Executive Summary

**Assessment Date**: September 21, 2025
**Phase**: LEVEL 2 Connectivity Implementation
**Dependencies**: LEVEL 1 Foundation (45% complete - gaps identified)
**Objective**: Implement 5 business services with multi-tenant architecture and event-driven communication

## Current Foundation Assessment

### ‚úÖ LEVEL 1 Foundation Status (from LEVEL_1_FOUNDATION_ASSESSMENT.md)

**Completed Components**:
- ‚úÖ Advanced Error DNA System - Complete with pattern recognition
- ‚úÖ Basic Service Registry - Central Hub operational (port 8010)
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL Database Service - Basic implementation (port 8008)
- ‚úÖ Health Monitoring - System-level monitoring
- ‚úÖ Docker Integration - Container setup complete
- ‚úÖ Basic Authentication - JWT token implementation

**‚ùå Critical LEVEL 1 Gaps Requiring Immediate Action**:
1. **Multi-Database Architecture**: Only PostgreSQL implemented (Need: ClickHouse, Weaviate, ArangoDB, DragonflyDB)
2. **Import Manager System**: Completely missing dependency injection framework
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: No messaging infrastructure (NATS/Kafka)
4. **Circuit Breaker Patterns**: Missing resilience implementation
5. **Service Discovery Enhancement**: Basic only, needs multi-tenant support
