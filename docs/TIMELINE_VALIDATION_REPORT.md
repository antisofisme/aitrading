## üí∞ **Cost Impact Analysis**

### **REVISED BUDGET BREAKDOWN**
```yaml
Original 10-Week Plan:
  Total Budget: $66K base + $5K risk = $71K

Extended 12-Week Plan:
  Phase 3: $21K (Days 31-40, including compliance)
  Phase 4: $29K (Days 41-60, extended production prep)
  Total: $103K (including $26K compliance infrastructure)

Cost Increase: $32K (+45%)
Reason: Compliance infrastructure + extended Phase 4
ROI: Still 53% savings vs $215K build-from-scratch
```

### **Cost Justification**
- **Compliance Infrastructure**: $26K for regulatory compliance
- **Extended Phase 4**: $8K for additional production preparation
- **Security Hardening**: $5K for enhanced security measures
