## üîß Claude Code Integration Strategies

### Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

#### 1. Hierarchical Coordination (Complex Phases)
```bash
# For Phase 2 & 3 - Complex business logic
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init { topology: "hierarchical" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "coordinator" }  # Phase coordinator
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "researcher" }  # Requirements analysis
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "coder" }       # Implementation
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "tester" }      # Quality assurance
```

#### 2. Mesh Coordination (Infrastructure Phases)
```bash
# For Phase 1 & 4 - Infrastructure work
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init { topology: "mesh" }
# All agents can communicate directly for faster coordination
```

#### 3. Star Coordination (Simple Phases)
```bash
# For Phase 0 - Simple configuration tasks
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init { topology: "star" }
# Central coordinator manages simple task distribution
```

### Tool Usage Optimization

#### Memory Management
```bash
# Store phase outcomes for knowledge transfer
mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage {
  action: "store",
  key: "phase_1_auth_patterns",
  value: "JWT implementation details..."
}

# Retrieve for next phase
mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage {
  action: "retrieve",
  key: "phase_1_auth_patterns"
}
```

#### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Track phase completion metrics
mcp__claude-flow__performance_report { format: "detailed" }
mcp__claude-flow__bottleneck_analyze { component: "ai_pipeline" }
```

### Concurrent Execution Patterns

#### Single Message Operations
```bash
# Always batch related operations
[Single Message]:
  TodoWrite { todos: [8-10 phase-specific todos] }
  Task("Agent 1", "Task description with coordination hooks", "agent-type")
  Task("Agent 2", "Task description with coordination hooks", "agent-type")
  Task("Agent 3", "Task description with coordination hooks", "agent-type")
  Write "file1.py"
  Write "file2.py"
  Edit "existing_file.py"
  Bash "mkdir -p required/directories"
```

#### Coordination Hooks (Every Agent)
```bash
# Pre-task coordination
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "Phase X: Task description"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-restore --session-id "phase-X"

# During work coordination
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --file "modified_file.py" --memory-key "phase/X/component"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notify --message "Component completed"

# Post-task coordination
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "phase-X-task-Y"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-end --export-metrics true
```
