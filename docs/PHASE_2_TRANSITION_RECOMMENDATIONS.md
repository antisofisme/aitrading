class AdvancedMLServiceOrchestrator(MLServiceOrchestrator):
    """Enhanced ML orchestrator for Phase 2"""

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Add AI pipeline components
        self.pipeline_manager = AIPipelineManager()
        self.model_trainer = AutoMLTrainer()
        self.prediction_cache = AdvancedPredictionCache()
```

## üìä Resource Requirements & Scaling

### Infrastructure Scaling Plan

#### Stage 1 Requirements
```yaml
# Minimal scaling from existing infrastructure
CPU: +20% (leverage existing optimization)
Memory: +30% (utilize 95% memory reduction gains)
Storage: +25% (use existing log tier management)
Network: Current capacity sufficient
```

#### Stage 2-3 Requirements
```yaml
# Moderate scaling for AI workloads
CPU: +50% (for model training/inference)
Memory: +75% (for model caching)
Storage: +100% (for model versioning)
GPU: Optional (for deep learning enhancement)
```

### Cost Impact Analysis
```
Phase 1 Achievement: $1,170 ‚Üí $220/month (81% reduction)
Phase 2 Addition: ~$150-200/month (AI services)
Total Phase 2: ~$370-420/month
Still 68% savings vs original baseline
```
