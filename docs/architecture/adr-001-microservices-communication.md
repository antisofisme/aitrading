# ADR-001: Microservices Communication Architecture

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - 2025-09-21

## Context
The AI Trading Platform consists of 11 microservices that need to communicate efficiently while maintaining:
- Sub-15ms AI decision latency
- 50+ ticks/second data processing
- High availability (99.99% uptime)
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Fault tolerance and graceful degradation

## Decision
We will implement a hybrid communication pattern combining:

### 1. Synchronous Communication (HTTP/REST)
**Use for**: User-facing operations, service coordination, administrative tasks

**Rationale**:
- Immediate response required for user interactions
- Simplifies error handling and debugging
- Natural request-response semantics
- Easy to implement authentication and authorization

**Implementation**:
- FastAPI framework for consistent REST APIs
- HTTP/2 for multiplexing and performance
- Circuit breakers for fault tolerance
- Connection pooling for efficiency

### 2. Asynchronous Communication (Event Streaming)
**Use for**: Market data distribution, AI processing pipeline, trade workflows

**Rationale**:
- Decouples services for better scalability
- Handles high-frequency data streams efficiently
- Enables parallel processing across AI models
- Provides natural backpressure mechanism

**Implementation**:
- Apache Kafka for high-throughput market data
- NATS for low-latency internal messaging
- Event sourcing for audit trails
- Dead letter queues for error handling

### 3. Direct Database Access (Multi-DB Pattern)
**Use for**: High-performance data operations, specialized storage needs

**Rationale**:
- Eliminates network latency for critical paths
- Leverages database-specific optimizations
- Reduces service dependencies for core data
- Enables database-level transactions

**Implementation**:
- PostgreSQL: OLTP operations, user data
- ClickHouse: Time-series analytics, market data
- DragonflyDB: High-performance caching
- Weaviate: Vector embeddings for AI
- ArangoDB: Graph relationships

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Performance**: Hybrid approach optimizes for different use cases
- **Scalability**: Asynchronous patterns handle high-frequency data
- **Reliability**: Multiple communication paths provide redundancy
- **Flexibility**: Can optimize individual service interactions

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Multiple communication patterns increase system complexity
- **Monitoring**: Need comprehensive observability across all patterns
- **Debugging**: Distributed tracing required for end-to-end visibility
- **Testing**: Complex integration testing scenarios

## Performance Targets

### Synchronous Operations
- **User API calls**: <100ms response time
- **Service-to-service**: <50ms internal calls
- **Authentication**: <10ms JWT validation
- **Health checks**: <5ms response time

### Asynchronous Operations
- **Market data**: <5ms event processing
- **AI pipeline**: <15ms end-to-end AI decision
- **Trade execution**: <1.2ms order placement
- **Event delivery**: <10ms broker latency

### Database Operations
- **PostgreSQL**: <10ms OLTP queries
- **ClickHouse**: <100ms analytics queries
- **DragonflyDB**: <1ms cache access
- **Weaviate**: <20ms vector similarity search

## Implementation Guidelines

### Service Design Principles
1. **API-First**: Define contracts before implementation
2. **Idempotency**: All operations should be safely retryable
3. **Timeout Handling**: Aggressive timeouts with exponential backoff
4. **Circuit Breaking**: Fail fast on service degradation
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback mechanisms for critical paths

### Message Patterns
1. **Command**: Direct service actions (synchronous)
2. **Event**: State change notifications (asynchronous)
3. **Query**: Data retrieval operations (synchronous/cached)
4. **Stream**: Continuous data flows (asynchronous)

### Error Handling Strategy
1. **Immediate Failures**: HTTP error codes with structured responses
2. **Timeout Failures**: Circuit breaker activation
3. **Async Failures**: Dead letter queues with retry policies
4. **Database Failures**: Connection pool recovery and failover

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics
- **Latency**: p50, p95, p99 for all communication patterns
- **Throughput**: Requests/second and events/second
- **Error Rates**: By service, operation, and communication type
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, network per service

### Tracing Requirements
- **Distributed Tracing**: Jaeger/Zipkin across all services
- **Correlation IDs**: Request tracking through async workflows
- **Performance Profiling**: Identify bottlenecks in real-time
- **Business Metrics**: Trading performance and AI accuracy

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Synchronous Foundation
- Implement HTTP/REST APIs for all services
- Establish service discovery and load balancing
- Deploy circuit breakers and health checks

### Phase 2: Asynchronous Enhancement
- Add event streaming for market data
- Implement AI processing pipelines
- Deploy monitoring and alerting

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization
- Optimize database access patterns
- Fine-tune caching strategies
- Implement performance benchmarking

## Alternatives Considered

### Pure Event-Driven Architecture
**Rejected**: While more scalable, introduces complexity for simple operations and makes debugging difficult for trading scenarios where immediate feedback is critical.

### Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd)
**Deferred**: Adds operational complexity. Will reconsider after achieving performance targets with current approach.

### GraphQL Federation
**Rejected**: Overhead not justified for trading system requirements. REST APIs provide better performance predictability.
