## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Microservices Architecture
**Decision:** Adopt microservices architecture over monolithic design
**Rationale:** Better scalability, technology diversity, fault isolation
**Consequences:** Increased operational complexity, network overhead

### ADR-002: Hybrid ML Approach
**Decision:** Combine unsupervised learning, classical ML, and deep learning
**Rationale:** Balance of speed, accuracy, and interpretability
**Consequences:** Increased model complexity, better performance

### ADR-003: Event-Driven Communication
**Decision:** Use Apache Kafka for inter-service communication
**Rationale:** High throughput, durability, replay capability
**Consequences:** Additional infrastructure complexity, eventual consistency

### ADR-004: Multi-Tier Caching
**Decision:** Implement L1 (memory) + L2 (Redis) caching strategy
**Rationale:** Optimal balance of speed and shared state
**Consequences:** Cache invalidation complexity, memory overhead

### ADR-005: Kubernetes Orchestration
**Decision:** Deploy on Kubernetes for container orchestration
**Rationale:** Industry standard, excellent scaling, ecosystem
**Consequences:** Learning curve, operational overhead

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Prevent cascade failures
- Graceful degradation
- Automatic recovery

### 2. Bulkhead Pattern
- Resource isolation
- Fault containment
- Independent scaling

### 3. Saga Pattern
- Distributed transaction management
- Compensation for failures
- Eventual consistency

### 4. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Separate read and write models
- Optimized data access patterns
- Better scalability

### 5. Event Sourcing
- Audit trail for all operations
- Replay capability
- Temporal queries
