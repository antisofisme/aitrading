# STRATEGIC REMEDIATION PLAN
## Comprehensive Documentation Fix Strategy for AI Trading Platform

---

## 🚨 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Based on the comprehensive error analysis identifying **78 critical issues** across plan2 documentation, this strategic remediation plan provides actionable steps to resolve all identified problems before development begins.

**Critical Finding**: Current documentation contains too many conflicts to safely proceed with development. Estimated 25-40% cost overruns and 2-4 week delays if not addressed immediately.

**Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive 4-phase remediation approach before any development work begins.
