    - Mock servers for early integration
    - Contract testing for validation

Pattern 2: Event-Driven Development
  Strategy: Use events for loose coupling
  Benefits: Teams can work independently
  Implementation:
    - Event schemas defined early
    - Event replay for testing
    - Circuit breakers for resilience

Pattern 3: Feature Flag Development
  Strategy: Deploy incomplete features behind flags
  Benefits: Continuous integration without risk
  Implementation:
    - Feature flags for gradual rollout
    - A/B testing capabilities
    - Risk-free deployment

Pattern 4: Microservice Decomposition
  Strategy: Clear service boundaries
  Benefits: Independent scaling and deployment
  Implementation:
    - Domain-driven design principles
    - Service mesh for communication
    - Independent CI/CD pipelines
```

### Integration Strategies

```yaml
Continuous Integration:
  Frequency: Multiple times daily
  Approach: Incremental integration
  Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions
