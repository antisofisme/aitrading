## Advanced ML Architecture Integration

### Core ML Components (Production-Ready)

#### 1. XGBoost Ensemble System
```
Architecture: Multi-model ensemble with temporal weighting
- Primary XGBoost models for trend/momentum signals
- Secondary models for volatility and regime detection
- Ensemble voting with confidence weighting
- Real-time model performance tracking
- Auto-rebalancing based on market conditions
```

#### 2. Market Regime Classifier
```
Technology Stack: Hybrid approach
- HMM (Hidden Markov Model) for regime state detection
- XGBoost for regime probability estimation
- Features: VIX, DXY, yield curves, correlation matrices
- Output: Bull/Bear/Sideways/Crisis regimes (4-state model)
- Model switching threshold: 70% regime confidence
```

#### 3. Cross-Asset Correlation Engine
```
DXY Impact Analysis:
- Real-time USD strength correlation with EURUSD/GBPUSD
- Gold inverse correlation monitoring (target: -0.7 to -0.8)
- Oil price relationships with currency pairs
- Bond yield differential impacts
- Correlation stability tracking (alert if drops below 0.6)
```

#### 4. Anti-Hallucination Safeguards
```
Statistical Validation Framework:
- Ensemble disagreement detection (>30% = high uncertainty)
- Prediction confidence bands (Bayesian uncertainty quantification)
- 3-sigma outlier rejection for training data
- Rolling window validation (prevent overfitting to recent data)
- Model drift detection (PSI < 0.1 threshold)
- Circuit breakers on low-confidence predictions (<0.6)
```

#### 5. Adaptive Learning System
```
Continuous Improvement Pipeline:
- Online learning with concept drift detection
- Model retraining triggers:
  * Performance degradation (Sharpe < 1.2 for 5 days)
  * Market regime changes (>70% confidence threshold)
  * New correlation patterns detected
  * Feature importance shifts (>20% change)
- A/B testing framework for model updates
- Rollback capabilities for failed deployments
```
