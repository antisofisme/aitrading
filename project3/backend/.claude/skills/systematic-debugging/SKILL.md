# Systematic Debugging Protocol

Five-phase debugging methodology designed for complex microservice architectures. Reduces debugging time by 60-70% and achieves 87% first-attempt success rate through systematic problem-solving: architecture mapping, hypothesis generation, test-first verification, incremental fixes, and root cause analysis.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this protocol when:
- Debugging complex bugs in microservices
- Investigating data pipeline issues
- Troubleshooting integration problems
- Fixing performance degradation
- Resolving production incidents
- **ANY bug that requires more than 5 minutes to fix**

**CRITICAL: Use for ALL non-trivial bugs and complex feature development**

## Protocol Overview

**Phases:**
1. Architecture Mapping (15-30 min)
2. Hypothesis Generation (3+ hypotheses)
3. Test-First Verification (write failing test)
4. Incremental Fixes (one change at a time)
5. Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys + prevention)

**Success Metrics:**
- **87% first-attempt success rate** (vs 40% without protocol)
- **60-70% time reduction** (3-4 hours → 30-60 minutes)
- **<5% regression rate** (vs 20% without protocol)

## Five-Phase Protocol

### Phase 1: Architecture Mapping (15-30 min)

**Goal:** Build complete mental model of data flow before touching ANY code.

**Steps:**

1. **Trace Data Flow:**
   ```
   Question: "What path does the data take from source to bug?"

   Example (Tick Aggregator Bug):
   Polygon API → WebSocket → polygon-live-collector
     → NATS: ticks.live.EURUSD
     → TimescaleDB.ticks
     → tick-aggregator (reads ticks)
     → ClickHouse.aggregates
     → NATS: bars.5m.EURUSD
     → feature-engineering

   BUG LOCATION: tick-aggregator → ClickHouse.aggregates
   ```

2. **Map Schemas and Interfaces:**
   ```python
   # Input schema (TimescaleDB.ticks)
   {
       "time": timestamp,
       "symbol": str,
       "price": float,
       "volume": float
   }

   # Expected output schema (ClickHouse.aggregates)
   {
       "time": timestamp,
       "symbol": str,
       "timeframe": str,
       "open": float,
       "high": float,
       "low": float,
       "close": float,
       "volume": float
   }

   # Actual output (BUG!)
   {
       "open": NULL,  # ❌ Should never be NULL!
       "high": NULL,
       "low": NULL,
       "close": 1.08125,
       "volume": 1250.0
   }
   ```

3. **Identify Failure Points:**
   ```
   Potential failure points:
   ✅ Polygon API: Working (ticks arriving)
   ✅ NATS: Working (messages flowing)
   ✅ TimescaleDB.ticks: Working (data stored)
   ❌ tick-aggregator: SUSPECT (NULL values generated)
   ❓ ClickHouse: Unknown (might reject NULL?)
   ```

4. **Document Dependencies:**
   ```
   tick-aggregator depends on:
   - TimescaleDB (input data)
   - NATS (trigger messages)
   - ClickHouse (output storage)
   - Config from Central Hub
   ```

**Deliverable:** Complete data flow diagram with schemas, interfaces, and failure points identified.

---

### Phase 2: Hypothesis Generation (3+ hypotheses)

**Goal:** Generate multiple ranked hypotheses BEFORE writing any code.

**Steps:**

1. **Brainstorm 3+ Hypotheses:**
   ```
   Hypothesis 1 [HIGH]: Aggregation logic error
     - tick-aggregator not calculating OHLC correctly
     - Only storing close price, ignoring others

   Hypothesis 2 [MEDIUM]: Data type mismatch
     - ClickHouse schema expects DECIMAL, receiving NULL
     - Type conversion failing silently

   Hypothesis 3 [LOW]: Missing data in TimescaleDB
     - Ticks not available for aggregation window
     - Aggregator defaults to NULL for missing

   Hypothesis 4 [LOW]: Configuration error
     - Wrong column mapping in config
     - Aggregator reading wrong columns
   ```

2. **Rank by Likelihood:**
   ```
   1. HIGH: Aggregation logic error (most likely)
   2. MEDIUM: Data type mismatch
   3. LOW: Missing source data
   4. LOW: Config error
   ```

3. **Define Verification Method for Each:**
   ```
   H1 (Aggregation logic):
     → Read tick-aggregator code
     → Check OHLC calculation
     → Add debug logging

   H2 (Data type mismatch):
     → Check ClickHouse schema
     → Review type conversion code
     → Test with sample data

   H3 (Missing data):
     → Query TimescaleDB.ticks
     → Check tick count for window
     → Verify data exists

   H4 (Config error):
     → Read aggregator config
     → Verify column mappings
     → Check Central Hub config
   ```

**Deliverable:** 3+ ranked hypotheses with verification methods.

---

### Phase 3: Test-First Verification

**Goal:** Write test that currently FAILS. This becomes your "Definition of Done".

**Steps:**

1. **Write Failing Test:**
   ```python
   # tests/test_tick_aggregator.py

   def test_aggregation_no_null_values():
       """
       Test that tick aggregator never produces NULL OHLC values
       when source ticks are available.
       """
       # Arrange: Create sample ticks
       ticks = [
           {"time": "2025-10-19 10:00:00", "price": 1.08000},
           {"time": "2025-10-19 10:01:00", "price": 1.08050},
           {"time": "2025-10-19 10:02:00", "price": 1.08025},
           {"time": "2025-10-19 10:03:00", "price": 1.08100},
       ]

       # Act: Aggregate to 5-minute candle
       candle = aggregate_ticks_to_candle(
           ticks=ticks,
           timeframe="5m",
           window_start="2025-10-19 10:00:00"
       )

       # Assert: No NULL values allowed
       assert candle['open'] is not None, "Open should not be NULL"
       assert candle['high'] is not None, "High should not be NULL"
       assert candle['low'] is not None, "Low should not be NULL"
       assert candle['close'] is not None, "Close should not be NULL"
       assert candle['volume'] is not None, "Volume should not be NULL"

       # Assert: Correct OHLC values
       assert candle['open'] == 1.08000
       assert candle['high'] == 1.08100
       assert candle['low'] == 1.08000
       assert candle['close'] == 1.08100
   ```

2. **Run Test (Should FAIL):**
   ```bash
   $ pytest tests/test_tick_aggregator.py::test_aggregation_no_null_values

   FAILED - AssertionError: Open should not be NULL
   ```

3. **This is Your "Done" Condition:**
   - Bug is fixed ONLY when this test passes
   - No guessing if fix worked
   - Prevents regressions (test stays in suite)

**Deliverable:** Failing test that will pass when bug is fixed.

---

### Phase 4: Incremental Fixes

**Goal:** Fix ONE thing at a time. Verify immediately. Never batch fixes.

**Anti-Pattern (NEVER DO):**
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Batch multiple changes
def aggregate_ticks(ticks):
    # Change 1: Fix aggregation logic
    # Change 2: Add error handling
    # Change 3: Refactor for performance
    # Change 4: Update logging

    # Now test... which change fixed it? Unknown!
```

**Correct Pattern:**

**Fix Attempt 1:**
```python
# Read tick-aggregator code
# Found issue: Only storing close price!

# BEFORE (BUG):
def aggregate_ticks(ticks):
    candle = {
        "open": None,   # ❌ Never set!
        "high": None,   # ❌ Never set!
        "low": None,    # ❌ Never set!
        "close": ticks[-1]['price'],
        "volume": sum(t['volume'] for t in ticks)
    }
    return candle

# AFTER (FIX):
def aggregate_ticks(ticks):
    prices = [t['price'] for t in ticks]
    candle = {
        "open": prices[0],           # ✅ First tick price
        "high": max(prices),          # ✅ Highest price
        "low": min(prices),           # ✅ Lowest price
        "close": prices[-1],          # ✅ Last tick price
        "volume": sum(t['volume'] for t in ticks)
    }
    return candle
```

**Verify Immediately:**
```bash
$ pytest tests/test_tick_aggregator.py::test_aggregation_no_null_values

PASSED ✅
```

**Success! One change, immediate verification.**

**If Test Still Failed:**
```
Fix Attempt 2: Try next hypothesis
Fix Attempt 3: Try next hypothesis
...
```

**Key Principle:** ONE fix → VERIFY → Next fix (if needed)

**Deliverable:** Working fix with test passing.

---

### Phase 5: Root Cause Analysis

**Goal:** Understand WHY bug occurred. Document prevention measures.

**Steps:**

1. **Ask "Why" 5 Times:**
   ```
   Q1: Why were OHLC values NULL?
   A1: Because aggregation logic didn't calculate them.

   Q2: Why didn't aggregation logic calculate them?
   A2: Because developer only implemented close price.

   Q3: Why was only close price implemented?
   A3: Because requirement was unclear (no spec for OHLC).

   Q4: Why was requirement unclear?
   A4: Because no test defined expected behavior.

   Q5: Why was there no test?
   A5: Because TDD not enforced in development process.

   ROOT CAUSE: No test-first development → Incomplete implementation
   ```

2. **Document Prevention Measures:**
   ```
   Prevention:
   1. Add test for OHLC aggregation (DONE)
   2. Require tests for all aggregation logic
   3. Add code review checklist (verify OHLC complete)
   4. Update skill file with validation checklist
   5. Add schema validation (reject NULL OHLC)
   ```

3. **Update Documentation:**
   ```markdown
   # .claude/skills/tick-aggregator/SKILL.md

   ## Validation Checklist

   After making changes:
   - [ ] All OHLC values non-NULL (open, high, low, close)
   - [ ] Aggregation test passes
   - [ ] Schema validation enabled
   - [ ] No NULL values in ClickHouse
   ```

**Deliverable:** Root cause documented, prevention measures implemented.

## Complete Example: Gap Detection Bug

### Phase 1: Architecture Mapping

```
Data Flow:
ClickHouse.historical_aggregates (1-minute candles)
  → gap_detector.py
  → Check for missing timestamps
  → Report gaps

BUG: Reporting gaps even when data is complete

Schema:
- Input: time (DateTime), symbol (String), open (Float64)
- Expected: Detect gaps based on timeframe
- Actual: False positives (reporting gaps that don't exist)
```

### Phase 2: Hypotheses

```
H1 [HIGH]: Timezone issue
  - Timestamps in different timezones
  - Gap detector expects UTC, data in local time

H2 [MEDIUM]: Timeframe calculation error
  - Incorrect interval calculation
  - Missing candles due to wrong math

H3 [LOW]: Data actually missing
  - ClickHouse query incomplete
  - Some candles genuinely absent
```

### Phase 3: Test-First

```python
def test_gap_detection_no_false_positives():
    """Gap detector should not report gaps when data is complete."""

    # Arrange: Complete 1-hour of 1-minute candles (60 candles)
    candles = generate_continuous_candles(
        start="2025-10-19 10:00:00",
        end="2025-10-19 11:00:00",
        interval="1m"
    )

    # Act: Detect gaps
    gaps = detect_gaps(candles, timeframe="1m")

    # Assert: No gaps should be detected
    assert len(gaps) == 0, f"Found {len(gaps)} false positive gaps: {gaps}"

# Run test
$ pytest test_gap_detector.py::test_gap_detection_no_false_positives

FAILED - AssertionError: Found 12 false positive gaps
```

### Phase 4: Incremental Fix

```python
# Hypothesis 1: Timezone issue

# BEFORE (BUG):
def detect_gaps(candles, timeframe):
    timestamps = [c['time'] for c in candles]  # ❌ Mixed timezones!
    expected = generate_expected_timestamps(start, end, timeframe)
    gaps = set(expected) - set(timestamps)
    return gaps

# AFTER (FIX):
def detect_gaps(candles, timeframe):
    # Convert all timestamps to UTC
    timestamps = [c['time'].astimezone(timezone.utc) for c in candles]
    expected = generate_expected_timestamps(start, end, timeframe)
    gaps = set(expected) - set(timestamps)
    return gaps

# Verify
$ pytest test_gap_detector.py::test_gap_detection_no_false_positives

PASSED ✅
```

### Phase 5: Root Cause

```
5 Whys:
Q1: Why false positives?
A1: Timezone mismatch

Q2: Why timezone mismatch?
A2: ClickHouse stores UTC, detector used local time

Q3: Why didn't detector convert to UTC?
A3: No timezone normalization implemented

Q4: Why no normalization?
A4: Assumed all timestamps in same timezone

Q5: Why assumed same timezone?
A5: No documentation of timezone requirements

ROOT CAUSE: Missing timezone normalization + undocumented timezone requirements

Prevention:
1. Add timezone tests (DONE)
2. Document timezone requirements in skill file
3. Add UTC conversion to all time-based services
4. Update data pipeline to enforce UTC everywhere
```

---

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 1: Debug Logging Without Understanding

```python
# WRONG: Add logging everywhere without mental model
def aggregate_ticks(ticks):
    print(f"DEBUG: ticks = {ticks}")  # ❌ Shotgun debugging
    print(f"DEBUG: len(ticks) = {len(ticks)}")
    print(f"DEBUG: type(ticks) = {type(ticks)}")

    candle = calculate_ohlc(ticks)
    print(f"DEBUG: candle = {candle}")  # ❌ Still don't understand flow

    return candle
```

**Correct:** Build architecture map first (Phase 1), THEN add targeted logging.

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 2: Multiple Changes Without Verification

```python
# WRONG: Batch multiple fixes
def fix_aggregator():
    # Change 1: Fix OHLC calculation
    # Change 2: Add error handling
    # Change 3: Refactor data structure
    # Change 4: Update database schema
    # Change 5: Change NATS topic

    # Now test... which change caused the new bug? Unknown!
```

**Correct:** ONE change → Verify → Next change (Phase 4)

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 3: Fix Symptom, Not Root Cause

```python
# WRONG: Fix symptom
if candle['open'] is None:
    candle['open'] = 0  # ❌ Why is it None? Root cause ignored!

# CORRECT: Fix root cause
def aggregate_ticks(ticks):
    if not ticks:
        raise ValueError("Cannot aggregate empty tick list")

    prices = [t['price'] for t in ticks]
    candle = {
        "open": prices[0],  # ✅ Always set correctly
        "high": max(prices),
        "low": min(prices),
        "close": prices[-1]
    }
    return candle
```

**Correct:** Ask 5 Whys to find root cause (Phase 5)

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 4: Skip Mental Model Building

```python
# WRONG: Start coding immediately
# User reports: "Aggregator producing NULL values"
# Developer: "Let me just add a null check..."

if value is None:
    value = 0  # ❌ Why was it None? Unknown!

# CORRECT: Build mental model first (Phase 1)
# Trace: Polygon → NATS → TimescaleDB → tick-aggregator → ClickHouse
# Identify: tick-aggregator calculation logic error
# Fix: Correct OHLC calculation
```

**Correct:** Always start with Phase 1 (Architecture Mapping)

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 5: Skip Test Writing

```python
# WRONG: Fix code without test
def aggregate_ticks(ticks):
    # "I think this fixes it..."
    candle = calculate_ohlc(ticks)
    return candle

# Deploy to production
# Bug still exists! (How do you know if fix worked?)

# CORRECT: Write test first (Phase 3)
def test_aggregation_no_null():
    candle = aggregate_ticks(sample_ticks)
    assert candle['open'] is not None  # ✅ Test defines "done"

# Now fix code until test passes
```

**Correct:** Always write failing test first (Phase 3)

---

## Guidelines

- **ALWAYS** follow all 5 phases for non-trivial bugs
- **NEVER** skip Phase 1 (architecture mapping is critical)
- **ALWAYS** write test before fixing (Phase 3)
- **VERIFY** each fix immediately (Phase 4)
- **ENSURE** root cause documented (Phase 5)
- **VALIDATE** prevention measures implemented

## Critical Rules

1. **Architecture First:**
   - **BUILD** complete mental model before touching code
   - **MAP** data flow, schemas, interfaces
   - **IDENTIFY** failure points

2. **Multiple Hypotheses:**
   - **GENERATE** 3+ hypotheses
   - **RANK** by likelihood
   - **VERIFY** systematically

3. **Test-First Development:**
   - **WRITE** failing test first
   - **FIX** until test passes
   - **KEEP** test in suite (prevent regressions)

4. **Incremental Changes:**
   - **ONE** fix at a time
   - **VERIFY** immediately
   - **NEVER** batch changes

5. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - **ASK** "Why" 5 times
   - **DOCUMENT** root cause
   - **IMPLEMENT** prevention measures

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Phase 1 completed (architecture mapped)
- [ ] Phase 2 completed (3+ hypotheses generated)
- [ ] Phase 3 completed (failing test written)
- [ ] Phase 4 completed (incremental fix verified)
