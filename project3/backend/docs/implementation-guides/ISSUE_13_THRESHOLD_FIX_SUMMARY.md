# Issue #13: Incomplete Threshold Detection - Fix Summary

## Problem
Historical processor was using a lenient threshold (implicitly allowing missing data) for marking gaps as "incomplete". For intraday timeframes (5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 4h), we expect 100% data completeness since forex markets run 24/5. However, daily and weekly timeframes can tolerate some missing data due to weekends and holidays.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Timeframe-Specific Threshold Configuration
Added threshold constants to `/mnt/g/khoirul/aitrading/project3/backend/00-data-ingestion/polygon-historical-downloader/src/gap_detector.py`:

```python
# Timeframe-specific threshold configuration
INTRADAY_TIMEFRAMES = ['5m', '15m', '30m', '1h', '4h']
DAILY_PLUS_TIMEFRAMES = ['1d', '1w']

INTRADAY_THRESHOLD = 1.0  # 100% - expect all bars (any missing = incomplete)
DAILY_THRESHOLD = 0.8     # 80% - weekends/holidays OK (20% missing allowed)
```

**Lines added:** 12-17 in `gap_detector.py`

### 2. New Completeness Check Method
Added `check_period_completeness()` method to `GapDetector` class:

```python
def check_period_completeness(
    self,
    symbol: str,
    start_date: str,
    end_date: str,
    timeframe: str
) -> Tuple[bool, float, int, int]:
    """
    Check if a period has complete data based on timeframe-specific thresholds

    Returns: (is_complete, completeness_ratio, bars_found, bars_expected)
    """
```

**Features:**
- Calculates expected bar count based on timeframe and date range
- Queries actual bar count from ClickHouse
- Applies appropriate threshold (100% for intraday, 80% for daily+)
- Returns detailed completeness metrics
- Logs which threshold is being used

**Lines added:** 169-247 in `gap_detector.py`

### 3. Expected Bar Calculator
Added `_calculate_expected_bars()` helper method:

```python
def _calculate_expected_bars(self, start_date: str, end_date: str, timeframe: str) -> int:
    """
    Calculate expected number of bars for a date range and timeframe

    Accounts for:
    - Forex market hours (24/5 - closed weekends)
    - Timeframe intervals
    - Holidays (approximate)
    """
```

**Bar calculations per timeframe:**
- `5m`: 288 bars/day (24h × 60min / 5min)
- `15m`: 96 bars/day (24h × 60min / 15min)
- `30m`: 48 bars/day (24h × 60min / 30min)
- `1h`: 24 bars/day
- `4h`: 6 bars/day
- `1d`: 1 bar/day
- `1w`: 1 bar per 5 trading days

**Lines added:** 249-315 in `gap_detector.py`

### 4. Updated Verification Logic in main.py
Modified verification section to use timeframe-aware thresholds:

**Location:** Lines 533-545 in `/mnt/g/khoirul/aitrading/project3/backend/00-data-ingestion/polygon-historical-downloader/src/main.py`

**Before:**
```python
if verification_ratio < 0.95:  # Less than 95% received
```

**After:**
```python
# Use timeframe-aware threshold for verification
from gap_detector import INTRADAY_TIMEFRAMES, INTRADAY_THRESHOLD, DAILY_THRESHOLD
if timeframe_str in INTRADAY_TIMEFRAMES:
    verification_threshold = INTRADAY_THRESHOLD  # 100% for intraday
else:
    verification_threshold = DAILY_THRESHOLD  # 80% for daily+

logger.info(
    f"📊 Verification: {bars_in_clickhouse}/{len(bars)} bars in ClickHouse "
    f"({verification_ratio*100:.1f}%) - Threshold: {verification_threshold*100}% for {timeframe_str}"
)

if verification_ratio < verification_threshold:
```

**Lines modified:** 533-545 in `main.py`

## Threshold Values Used

| Timeframe | Threshold | Reasoning |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 5m        | 100%      | Intraday - expect all bars |
| 15m       | 100%      | Intraday - expect all bars |
| 30m       | 100%      | Intraday - expect all bars |
| 1h        | 100%      | Intraday - expect all bars |
| 4h        | 100%      | Intraday - expect all bars |
| 1d        | 80%       | Daily - weekends/holidays OK |
| 1w        | 80%       | Weekly - holidays tolerated |

## Edge Cases Handled

### Intraday Timeframes (100% threshold)
- ✅ **100% complete** (288/288 bars) → COMPLETE
- ❌ **99.9% complete** (287/288 bars, 1 missing) → INCOMPLETE
- ❌ **95% complete** (274/288 bars) → INCOMPLETE
- ❌ **80% complete** (230/288 bars) → INCOMPLETE

**Behavior:** ANY missing bar = INCOMPLETE (strict)

### Daily+ Timeframes (80% threshold)
- ✅ **100% complete** (5/5 bars) → COMPLETE
- ✅ **80% complete** (4/5 bars) → COMPLETE (weekend gap tolerated)
- ❌ **79% complete** (3/5 bars) → INCOMPLETE

**Behavior:** Up to 20% missing allowed (lenient for holidays)

## Logging Enhancements

All threshold checks now log:
1. Which threshold is being used (100% vs 80%)
2. Timeframe being checked
3. Actual bar count vs expected
4. Completeness ratio
5. Final status (COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE)

**Example log output:**
```
Using intraday threshold: 100.0% for 5m
📊 Completeness Check - EUR/USD 5m: 287/288 bars (99.7%) - Threshold: 100% - Status: INCOMPLETE
```

```
Using daily+ threshold: 80.0% for 1d
📊 Completeness Check - EUR/USD 1d: 4/5 bars (80.0%) - Threshold: 80% - Status: COMPLETE
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite in `test_threshold_logic.py`:
- ✅ Validates threshold constants (100% intraday, 80% daily+)
- ✅ Tests all 7 timeframes
- ✅ Tests 10 edge case scenarios
- ✅ Verifies completeness calculations

**Test result:** ALL TESTS PASSED ✅

## Files Modified

1. **gap_detector.py** (167 lines added)
   - Lines 12-17: Threshold constants
   - Lines 169-247: `check_period_completeness()` method
   - Lines 249-315: `_calculate_expected_bars()` method

2. **main.py** (13 lines modified)
   - Lines 533-545: Timeframe-aware verification logic

3. **test_threshold_logic.py** (95 lines added)
   - New test file for validation

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ Intraday gaps with 95% data marked as "complete"
- ❌ No distinction between intraday and daily timeframes
- ❌ Weekends incorrectly flagged as incomplete for daily data
- ❌ No logging of which threshold is applied

### After Fix
- ✅ Intraday gaps require 100% completeness
- ✅ Daily+ timeframes tolerate 20% missing (weekends/holidays)
- ✅ Clear logging shows which threshold is used and why
- ✅ Expected bar calculations account for forex market hours
- ✅ Verification logic now uses same timeframe-aware thresholds

## Next Steps

The new `check_period_completeness()` method can be used in:
1. Gap detection workflows
2. Data quality reports
3. Historical download verification
4. Scheduled completeness checks

## Configuration

Thresholds are hardcoded constants but can be easily converted to configuration if needed:

```yaml
# Future config.yaml enhancement
thresholds:
  intraday: 1.0  # 100%
  daily: 0.8     # 80%
  timeframes:
    intraday: ['5m', '15m', '30m', '1h', '4h']
    daily: ['1d', '1w']
```

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Tested:** ✅ YES (test_threshold_logic.py passes)
**Ready for deployment:** ✅ YES
