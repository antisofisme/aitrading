# Migration Log - Data Ingestion Services

## 2025-10-04: ClickHouse Consumer → Data Bridge Migration

### Summary
Migrated `clickhouse-consumer` to `data-bridge` with Database Manager integration.

### Changes Made

**Old Architecture:**
```
00-data-ingestion/clickhouse-consumer/
└── Direct ClickHouse writes
```

**New Architecture:**
```
02-data-processing/data-bridge/
└── Database Manager (TimescaleDB + DragonflyDB)
```

### Migration Details

1. **Directory Movement:**
   - Source: `00-data-ingestion/clickhouse-consumer/`
   - Destination: `00-data-ingestion/_archived/clickhouse-consumer/`
   - Date: 2025-10-04

2. **Code Refactoring:**
   - Removed: `clickhouse_client.py` (direct ClickHouse access)
   - Added: Database Manager integration via `DataRouter`
   - Updated: `main.py` to use TickData/CandleData models
   - Simplified: `config.py` (no more ClickHouse credentials)

3. **Docker Deployment:**
   - Commented out: `clickhouse-consumer` service in docker-compose.yml
   - Added: `data-bridge` service with Database Manager access
   - Status: ✅ Production ready

### New Data Flow

```
Polygon Services
    → NATS/Kafka (messaging)
    → Data Bridge (dedup + route)
    → Database Manager (smart routing)
    → TimescaleDB (storage) + DragonflyDB (cache)
```

### Benefits

1. **Abstraction**: Services no longer need to know database specifics
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to add ClickHouse, Weaviate, ArangoDB later
3. **Performance**: Multi-level caching (L1 + L2)
4. **Reliability**: Connection pooling and retry logic
5. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for database operations

### Verification

```bash
# Check data-bridge is running
docker ps --filter "name=data-bridge"

# Check logs
docker logs suho-data-bridge --tail 50

# Verify Database Manager accessible
docker exec suho-data-bridge python3 -c "from components.data_manager import DataRouter; print('✅ OK')"
```

### Deprecated Services

- ❌ `clickhouse-consumer` - Replaced by `data-bridge`
- ❌ Direct ClickHouse writes - Use Database Manager instead
