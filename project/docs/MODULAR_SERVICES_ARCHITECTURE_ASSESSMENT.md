- **Timeline Risk**: 76% of services missing vs planned architecture

### 8.2 Mitigation Strategies
1. **Leverage Existing Assets**: Migrate from original codebase immediately
2. **Phased Implementation**: Focus on critical path services first
3. **Parallel Development**: Infrastructure and AI teams work simultaneously
4. **Risk Monitoring**: Weekly service completion tracking

## Conclusion

**Current Status**: Infrastructure foundation (80% complete) but critical business and AI functionality missing (0% complete).

**Key Finding**: The project has solid infrastructure groundwork but lacks the core AI/ML and business services required for a hybrid AI trading platform.

**Recommendation**: Immediate focus on migrating existing AI services from the original codebase while developing missing business functionality in parallel.

**Success Criteria**:
- Achieve 15+ operational services within 4 sprints
- Complete AI/ML pipeline migration within 2 sprints
- Implement core business services within 3 sprints

---
**Next Actions**: Prioritize AI service migration and trading engine implementation as blocking items for project success.
