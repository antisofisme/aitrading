## 🚨 **Critical Success Factors**

### **Week-by-Week Validation**
```yaml
Week 4 Gate: Feature Engineering must be perfect before Week 5
Week 5 Gate: ML model must work before considering Week 6
Week 6 Gate: Enhancement must add value before Week 7
Week 7 Gate: Advanced features must integrate cleanly

NO ADVANCEMENT until current week is 100% successful!
```

### **Fallback Strategy**
```yaml
If Week 4 struggles: Reduce to 3 indicators instead of 5
If Week 5 struggles: Focus on XGBoost optimization, skip ensemble
If Week 6 complex: Skip LightGBM, proceed dengan single model
If Week 7 complex: Skip deep learning entirely

ALWAYS have simpler working version!
```

### **Library Management**
```yaml
Week 4: Master TA-Lib + pandas (2 libraries)
Week 5: Add XGBoost + joblib (2 new libraries)
Week 6: Add LightGBM only (1 new library) - OPTIONAL
Week 7: Add PyTorch basic (1 new library) - BONUS

NEVER learn more than 2 new libraries per week!
```
